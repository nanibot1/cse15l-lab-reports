> or pressing **Ctrl** + **Shift** + **`** to open up a new Terminal.

### Remotely Connecting

> In the Terminal, type ``` ssh cs15lfa22--@ieng6.ucsd.edu ``` where the `--` are the two letters in your account.

> If you are remotely connecting to this server for the first time, you may encounter this message:

```
⤇ ssh cs15lfa22--@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

> If so, type yes.

> However, if you have already connected to the server before and come across this message:

> proceed on.

> When finished with your session on the server, you can log out using:

* Pressing **Ctrl** + **D**
* Run the command ```exit```

> Congratulations!  You have learned to successfully connect to the server using ssh.

### Trying Some Commands

> Now after connecting to the server, try to run some of these commands:

* ```cd ~```
* ```cd```
* ```ls -lat```
* ```ls -a```
* ```ls <directory> where <directory> is /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lfa22/cs15lfa22abc```, where the ```abc``` is one of the other group members’ username
* ```cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lfa22/public/hello.txt ~/```
* ```cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lfa22/public/hello.txt```

> For example, using ```cat``` looks like this:

### Moving Files with ```scp```

> Using ```scp``` helps the user move files from their computer to the server.

> Proceed to create a Java file **on your computer** called *WhereAmI.java* and put the following contents into it:

```
class WhereAmI {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("os.name"));
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.name"));
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.home"));
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.dir"));
  }
}
```

> Compile and run the WhereAmI program using the `javac` and `java` commands to test whether or not the code works. Your input should look like the following:

```
javac WhereAmI.java
java WhereAmI
```

> and the output should look like the following:

> Now, to move *WhereAmI.java* to the server, run this command (using your account name in place of `--`):

```scp WhereAmI.java cs15lfa22--@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/```
